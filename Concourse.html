<h3> HC 3 Summary </h3>
<pre>
Concourse → Overall Niche Grade: B
a. Safety: C- (Higher assault and robbery crimes than national average.)
b. Transportation: B+ (Multiple forms of reliable transportation and city parking
available.)
c. Attractions/Activities: A (Multiple parks, restaurants, bars, activities, and nightlife
events.)

When considering a place to book an Airbnb, it's important to consider many of the qualities
that make each neighborhood a good place to live, with some exceptions. Generally, because airbnb's
usually indicate a short stay in a specific neighborhood, most of the qualities which make a
Neighborhood desirable in the long-term can be ignored (good schools, good doctors, best for retirees).
On the other hand, there's an emphasis on benefits that can be appreciated in the short-term, such as
safety and accessibility to local attractions. One feature which is more complicated is the cost of living,
because, while price is important, we must still consider the demand for luxury visits, which are more
desirable in a short-term destination (which Airbnb specializes in) than an actual living situation.

<h3> HC 7 and 8 Summary </h3>
<pre>
	The Bronx makes up 1,091 of the 48,895 listings in New York City. In the Bronx
amongst all neighborhoods with Airbnbs, the average cost of staying at an Airbnb is
approximately $87.50, compared to the average cost of renting a Airbnb in the city being
approximately $152.72. Concourse makes up 50 of the 1,091 listings in the Bronx.

	Within the Bronx, the mean prices in Bronx neighborhoods are typically under $100
though Riverdale is an anomalous neighborhood with an average cost of rent of over $400.
The program shows that the average cost of an Airbnb in Concourse is less than the cost of
Airbnbs in the Bronx as a whole. The lower standard deviation of the concourse data suggests
that the costs for renting an Airbnb is mostly lower than a 100 dollars as compared to the entirety
of the Bronx that has outliers in it which increases the standard deviation.
